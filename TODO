DONE|   *change Ocean::kill instead idx to use a pointer to organism
DONE|   *change Ocean::move so before setting new x,y check Ocean::fishMap :
            -if conlict:
                _call checker function
                    (*skype*)
            -if not sets new x,y
DONE|   *change blue sea texture to match view resolution
DONE|   *optimize textures dimensions in general
DONE|   *limit zoom
****|         and move
DONE|   *decide about the world size
            -standard size and just zoom in
            -VAST WORLD see only a part and we may choose what to draw
****|   *clock and render timing
****|   *implement user actions
            -fishnet

            edit: SERIOUS BUG IN COMMIT 41b8a...we should check the code after this commit
            ammend: after debugging it seems that createAndAddRandFish causes sometimes sigsegv.
****|   *find a way to publish TODO file without commits........:P
DONE|   *Complete Ocean.cpp in comments
DONE|   *Optimize rand selection
****|   *THE FUCKING INTERPOLATION FTW!!!!
****|	*Which Organism members should be protected? Which private?
****|	*Check for memory leaks, maybe use a Boost pointer container?
DONE|   *Fix rand implementation not to produce 0,0 as dx,dy
DONE|   *Limit pollution sources with clocks <-- Explain
****|   *add pollution shader (possible post-fx fisheye with colorize) check sfml samples <- no you check
****|   *clickable icons next to stats show category spesific information
****|   *Possible drag view..
DONE|   *In Big world view the dimensions are not correct yet
****|   *Amount of zoom must be common between run and pause..fix <- no you fix
****|	*Separate event code from the main loop
****|   *add about screen
****|   *Add organism whenever we want
****|   *<add todo> <- no you add
