## OCEAN LIFE MANIFESTO
Ocean life is a C++ 101 project on steroids.

## Description
C++ 101 assignment was a command line based simulation of a seabed. The simulation included several classes of fish and subclasses, in order to practice OOP, that moved in the seabed and could eat each other based on some rules.

## CAN I PLEASE TRY IT?
NOBODY can build ocean life anymore, NOT EVEN ITS OWN CREATORS, it is built with **qmake** because at the time the authors decided that Qt Creator was the best C++ IDE after weeks of research. It is also build on top of an old version of **SFML** (1.6). Future efforts to port OCEAN LIFE in SFML 2 and a better build system like **cmake** [failed](http://www.screenr.com/CWAH)

Fortunately you can download and extract the 7z file for an already built executable!

*Press M for mute. Also you can add organisms by dragging instead of only one by pressing and holding X while holding an organism with left click. You can drag the pollution with right click for an AWESOME effect.*

## History
One gets easily bored especially if the following are present:
- Stale environment in greek college
- Passion about programming
- Extremely easy college assignments

so OCEAN LIFE was an opportunity to test/learn/practice:
- First time collaboration using Git, issue tracking, logs
- Basic game development principles
- actual C++
- Various make systems, git workflows and SW engineering practices for efficiency

as a result, a project was born that was way out of the scope of C++ 101

## Features
- SFML 1.6 2D Graphics
- Advanced [game loop](http://www.koonsolo.com/news/dewitters-gameloop/) for lag-free experience
- Smooth animations
- Efficient data structure background using STL
- [Class creation factory](https://github.com/sespiros/ceid-projects/blob/ocean_life/src/classregistry.cpp) for extremely modular design
- Custom HD textures
- Custom made UI and UI elements built from scratch
- Carefully designed UX
- Custom made animation effects
- IT EVEN HAS A MAGIKARP THAT EVOLVES
- YOU NAME IT!!!
