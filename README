Stroustrup, pg. 405-406: Ενημέρωσα constructors σύμφωνα με το πρότυπο της C++. Επίσης πλεον η global_count δουλεύει.

Αρχική μορφή του Ocean, νέα μέθοδος getType του Organism, μικρές αλλαγές στο test.cpp για να δείξουν τις αλλαγές. Ερώτημα: global_count deprecated?

Tried to encapsulate graphics initialization, but multiple includes FUCKING EVERYWHERE wouldn't allow me. screens.h should be deprecated.

I [Petros] created a static const map to connect fish types with their generation weights; the map creation itself is defined in organism's private createWeightMap()
one can tinker with the fish weights there. The rest is implemented in the Ocean class, as genRandType() & createAndAddRandFish().
One could also transfer genRandType() to the Helper class.

I [Spiros] changed the blue texture to match the view dimension and 16*25 objects,the resolution of 1024*600 does not match actual background dimensions.
Ocean::kill also delete the Organism from fishMap.
Modified TODO file, easier to read. We add whatever need to be done even the simple ones...
Bug found after commit 41b8aa

"It's funny, how a single line can introduce such a serious bug."

Thu Dec 29 02:40:57 GTBST 2011
Fixed Ocean::initMap implementation, added collide, a temporary move old one is deprecated now...
Added some todos..αυτά

Fri Dec 30 04:53:20 GTBST 2011
Changed fish and fishMap into the ultimate fishMap std::map, updated all the methods to use the new format.
Notice how fast it is...everything works..check TODO for next goals..

I [Petros]:
        * Implemented a more sophisticated eating mechanism using bitfields (see member Organism::eatField) and the corresponding checking method (canEat). Do mess around with each organism's eating habits.
        * Fixed an endless loop bug (0x02) found in Ocean::collide. That is, each organism shall choose a random direction from a two-dimensional array named Helper::dir[8][2] for eight rounds; after that, the organism is discarded.
        * fishMap's iterator is now incremented (in Ocean::update) immediately after being evaluated for Ocean::collide(Organism*). That accounts for invalidation after erasing a map's pair (in Ocean::kill). There shouldn't be any issues implementing a bearing mechanism.
        * Added an Organism::kill() method that decrements each Organism's count after dying. Another method to increment count might be needed.

I [Petros]:
        * Introduced a pollution system (position[x, y], radius). A static vector<Pollution *> holds the current pollution sources; each source has a lifespan (4th default constructor parameter). No sprites for the moment, just a logging routine. Deletion now should deallocate the pointers to pollution objects, yet we could check for memory leaks.
        * Ocean::update now also runs tickPollution()
        * Ocean::populate now checks for object existence before adding a new one at the same spot.

I [Spiros]:
        *Deleted screenmanager implementation, caused segfaults in linux.
        *Fixed random generation in Ocean::collide, in Ocean::Cpp. (Possible memory leak fixed).


Tue Jan 3 19:02:06 GTBST 2012
I [Petros]:
        * Added a draw method for the pollution. Use Pollution::bind(sf::RenderWindow*) to first bind the render window, draw each pollution source, the unbind with Pollution::bind(0)
        * typedef for std::map<int, Organism*>::iterator

Wed Jan 4 18:10:56 GTBST 2012
I [Spiros]:
        * Fixes in pause.h and run.h and retextures.
        * Added methods for computing and drawing stats for categories.
        * Added some additional logic (deaths, Consume per week, age, turns)
        * Added Log Box clickable.

Wed Jan 4 20:10:56 GTBST 2012
I [Spiros]:
        * Added new pollution texture.
        * Optimizations in constructors and Organism Images.

Wed Jan 4 22:48:50 GTBST 2012
I [Spiros]:
        * Added two different world sizes
        * Clickable play/pause
        * Controlled Zoom only 2 times
        * Move View with arrows **CHECK TODO**

Thu Jan 5 01:05:06 GTBST 2012
I [Petros]:
        * Fixed coords in Helper (x for width, y for height)
        * Packed Pollution and changed the spreading algorithm

Thu Jan 5 20:38:32 GTBST 2012
I [Petros]:
        * Implemented Dewitter's game loop in dewittersrun.h. Uncomment screentest.cpp to test. However, on my laptop, render runs at ~27 FPS (~60 FPS without the App.Display() line). Y U SO SLOW?

Mon Jan 9 04:39:90 GTBST 2012
I [Spiros]:
        * Fixed Dimensions of all screens.
        * Added method to get organism coordinates
        * "Fixed" 25 fps "bug"....LAWLZ check pause screen diff.....nuff said

Mon Jan 9 05:43:45 GTBST 2012
I [Spiros]:
        * Added a clever implementation of interpolation...obvious but we couldn't see...speed 37 we can change that..
        *Changed textures of small and big background

Mon Jan 9 18:43:45 GTBST 2012
I [Spiros]:
        * Added new pixel-perfect textures!!!
        * Added stats per Organism
